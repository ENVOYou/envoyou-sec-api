The official backend API for the [Envoyou](https://envoyou.com) platform. This service aggregates environmental data from multiple global sources to calculate a **Composite Environmental Verification Score (CEVS)**, providing a standardized metric for corporate environmental performance.

## üìñ Overview

The CEVS Aggregator API acts as a robust data pipeline and scoring engine. It connects to various official data sources (e.g., EPA, EEA, ISO), normalizes the incoming data into a consistent schema, and applies a sophisticated scoring algorithm to generate the CEVS for a given company.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Multi-Source Data Aggregation**: Integrates with key environmental data providers:
  - **EPA (USA)**: Facility and power plant emissions data (Envirofacts, CAMPD).
  - **EEA (Europe)**: Industrial pollution and renewable energy statistics.
  - **EDGAR**: Global urban emissions data.
  - **ISO**: ISO 14001 certification status.
- **Composite Environmental Verification Score (CEVS)**: A proprietary scoring model that provides a holistic view of a company's environmental impact and commitment.
- **Secure API Access**: All critical endpoints are protected by API key authentication.
- **Tier-Based Rate Limiting**: Different usage tiers (Basic, Premium) to manage API load.
- **Robust Caching**: In-memory and file-based caching for improved performance and reduced external API calls.
- **Standardized Data Schemas**: All data is normalized into a clean, predictable format.
- **Asynchronous Framework**: Built with FastAPI for high performance and scalability.
- **Dockerized**: Ready for containerized deployment in any environment.

## üìö API Documentation

For detailed information on all available endpoints, request/response formats, and usage examples, please refer to the official **[API Documentation](API_DOCUMENTATION.md)**.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Docker & Docker Compose (Recommended)

### 1. Environment Setup

First, create a `.env` file from the example template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, open the `.env` file and configure the necessary variables. At a minimum, you should set your API keys. For development, you can use the demo keys.

```env
# .env
# --- General Server Configuration ---
PORT=8000
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# --- Security ---
# For production, generate secure keys. See generate_keys.py
API_KEYS="demo_key_basic_2025:DemoApp:basic,demo_key_premium_2025:PremiumApp:premium"
MASTER_API_KEY="your_secure_master_key_for_admin_tasks"

# --- External API Keys ---
CAMPD_API_KEY="YOUR_EPA_CAMPD_API_KEY" # Get from https://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/cam-api-portal
```

### 2. Installation

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Running the Server

#### Local Development (with Uvicorn)

The server supports live reloading, which is ideal for development.

```bash
uvicorn app.api_server:app --reload --port 8000 --log-level debug
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

#### Production (with Docker)

Using Docker is the recommended way to run the application in production.

```bash
# Build and run the services in the background
docker-compose up --build -d

# Check the logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop the services
docker-compose down
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The application is configured via environment variables, which are loaded by `pydantic-settings` from the `.env` file. Key configuration options are defined in `app/config.py`.

- `PORT`: The port the server will run on.
- `LOG_LEVEL`: The logging level (e.g., `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`).
- `API_KEYS`: A comma-separated list of valid API keys and their tiers.
- `CAMPD_API_KEY`: Your API key for the EPA CAMPD service.
- `*_XLSX_PATH`: Paths to local reference data files (EDGAR, ISO, Policy).

## üß™ Running Tests

The project uses `pytest` for testing.

```bash
pytest
```
