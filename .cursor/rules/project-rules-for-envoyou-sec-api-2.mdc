rules: |
  - This project is an API agent system named **envoyou-sec-api**.
  - Code must follow **PEP8** Python style conventions.
  - Use **async/await** for I/O and API calls whenever possible.
  - Keep code modular: put helpers in `utils/`, tools in `tools/`, and the main entry in `main.py`.
  - Always include docstrings (in English) for functions, classes, and modules.
  - Use clear, descriptive variable and function names in English.
  - When adding a new feature, prefer **configurable options** via `config.py` instead of hardcoding.
  - Include logging (not print) for debugging and tracing execution.
  - Tests or validation scripts should be suggested when introducing new modules.
