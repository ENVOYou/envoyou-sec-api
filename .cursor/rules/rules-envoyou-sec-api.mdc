rules: |
  - Agents must respect modular architecture (each service self-contained).
  - Do not modify project structure without explicit instruction.
  - Every tool call must be logged with: agent_name, action, timestamp, input_refs, output_refs, status.
  - Role boundaries:
      * acquisition_agent: fetch raw data only
      * etl_crosswalk_agent: transform and map identifiers
      * audit_trail_agent: log all events
      * api_serving_agent: finalize and serve reports
  - On error, log failure and continue workflow with status "FAILED".
  - Only use registered tools (fetch_epa_ghg_data, save_raw_data_to_s3, etc.).
  - Never expose secrets (API keys, raw S3 paths) in user-facing responses.
  - All outputs must be strict JSON or valid API responses.
