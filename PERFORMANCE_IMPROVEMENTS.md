# Performance & Quality Report

## Overview
This document summarizes the performance optimizations and data quality improvements implemented as part of the project's production-readiness phase. The primary goals were to reduce latency, decrease external dependencies, and ensure data consistency across all integrated sources.

## 1. Performance Optimizations

### ISO Client Caching
- **Implementation**: Applied `@lru_cache` to all data loading methods (`_load_from_excel`, `_load_from_csv_or_json`) and the main data retrieval method (`get_iso14001_certifications`).
- **Impact**: Drastically reduces redundant file I/O and network requests for ISO 14001 certification data, especially in high-traffic scenarios.

### EEA Client Caching
- **Implementation**: Leveraged `@lru_cache` on the `_get_parquet_data` method, which is the single entry point for downloading large Parquet files from the EEA API.
- **Impact**: Prevents re-downloading and re-processing of large datasets for subsequent requests involving the same EEA indicators.

### EDGAR Client Caching
- **Implementation**: Utilizes a global, in-memory dictionary (`_GLOBAL_CACHE`) keyed by file path and modification time. This ensures that the large EDGAR Excel file is parsed only once per file version.
- **Impact**: The most significant performance gain, as it avoids repeatedly parsing a large and complex spreadsheet. The cache is shared across all instances of the client.

## 2. Data Quality & Consistency

### Comprehensive Country Name Normalization
- **System**: A centralized mapping utility was created in `app/utils/mappings.py`.
- **Features**:
  - Maps over **260 variations** (common names, official names, ISO codes) for 50+ countries to a single canonical format (e.g., "DE", "Deutschland" -> "germany").
  - Ensures reliable data joining and filtering across all data sources.
- **Integration**: This normalization is applied consistently in the `EEAClient`, `ISOClient`, and `EDGARClient` before any filtering or data aggregation occurs.

### Enhanced Client Compatibility
- **EEA Client**: A generic `get_indicator()` method was added to provide a stable interface for the API routes, intelligently routing requests to the correct internal data-fetching function based on the indicator type.
- **Schema Normalization**: The `app/utils/schema.py` module ensures that data from different sources (like EPA Envirofacts) is transformed into a consistent, predictable structure before being returned by the API.

## 3. Test Coverage

### Global Routes (`tests/test_global_routes.py`)
- **Coverage**: All `/global/*` endpoints are covered by dedicated tests.
- **Validation**: Tests verify response structures, filter functionality, and error handling for missing or invalid parameters.

### CEVS Logic (`tests/test_cevs.py`)
- **Coverage**: Multiple scenario-based tests validate the CEVS calculation logic.
- **Validation**: Tests confirm the correct application of bonuses and penalties from different data sources and check for edge cases (e.g., country-specific policy bonuses).

## 4. Summary of Results

- **Performance**: Latency for repeated, complex queries has been significantly reduced due to multi-layer caching.
- **Reliability**: Data consistency is greatly improved, making the CEVS score more accurate and reliable.
- **Maintainability**: Centralized utilities for mapping and schemas make it easier to add new data sources in the future.
